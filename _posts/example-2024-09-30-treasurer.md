As treasurer, you will be responsible for treasuring. This involved watching our money to make sure it doesn't go away, and even being aware of money that chooses to come to us. You must vigilantly guard our coffers and be prepared to settle financial disputes with the AMS if necessary. You may also develop a propensity for writing unnecessarily long descriptions to demonstrate how this format handles them.
