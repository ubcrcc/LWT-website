_Built with [Lab Website Template](https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs)_

Tips to tell people in docs:
- Be careful with your extensions on images! Make sure you're using the correct one (eg. .png, .jpg, .jpeg, etc.), although all of those should work (.heic?).
- Try to avoid using spaces or special characters when naming files (use underscores or dashes instead).
