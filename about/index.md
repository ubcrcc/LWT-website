Every year, UBCRCC chooses one appeal of the year from the Canadian Red cross to fundraise for (as well as fundraising for local non-profits such as mission possible). The goal of this committee is to plan and run events throughout the year to raise money for these causes!

The humanitarian movement is an initiative aimed at empowering both highschool and university students interested in humanitarian issues through our annual humanitarians training conference. Through the conference, we engage youth leaders with humanitarian issues and support them in making an impact within their local and global community.
