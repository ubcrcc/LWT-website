# Welcome!

UBC Red Cross is a student-run non-profit club that upholds the seven values of the Canadian Red Cross: humanity, voluntary service, impartiality, neutrality, independence, unity, and universality. Through our five committees, we run volunteer events, host training sessions, organize speaker series, raise money, and so much more. Weâ€™re committed to improving the UBC and Vancouver community, as well as supporting global causes.
